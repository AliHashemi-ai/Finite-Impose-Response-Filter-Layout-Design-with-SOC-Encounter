# Finite Impose Response Filter Layout Design with SOC Encounter
In this project, we design Finite Impose Response Filter layout with SOC Encounter. The goal of this project was to get familier with the software SOC-Encounter. We first designed our filter layout with SOC-Encounter then applied a test-bench with verilog and check it's output.
This project is done as the final project of Methodologies and Algorithms for ESL Design Automation (MSEDL) course. 
The report is in Persion but results in it are all in English.
